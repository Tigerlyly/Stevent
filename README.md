# Steven't
A minecraft bot to play minecraft like a relatively normal player. But isn't a normal player at all.

This project is still mostly conceptual, a lot of work needs to be done

## Setup
* On a new linux (Debian/Ubuntu) system, or WSL on windows
  * Look over `setup/shared-vars.sh` to see the directories that will be involved
  * Clone the git and run `setup/prepare-system.sh` to install necessary packages and fetch the minecraft server jar
  * Use `start-server.sh` and `stop-server.sh` in `setup` to run a local minecraft server for testing

## Goals
* Some possible end goals
  * Identify a good location, collect materials, and build a giant procedurally generated castle
* Initial goals
  * Build a simple goal-driven system that breaks tasks down into manageable subtasks and executes them
  * Collect wood and make wooden tools
  * Collect stone and make stone tools
  * Collect iron and make iron tools
